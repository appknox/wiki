# Work flow

This is how we do things.

## Project Management

1. GiHub (Duh!)
2. [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)

## Git

1. [A Successful Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
2. One thing that is different from `A Successful Git Branching Model` is that, we `NEVER` merge locally. All the merges must be made on GitHub in order to capture the merge conversation and history.
3. Tool to accompany `A Successful Git Branching Model`: [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
4. [Cheat Sheet for Git-Flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

## Team Chat

1. [FlowDock](https://www.flowdock.com/)
